###Triangle Tracker Project
This is a webpage that takes three values from a user and works on them to determine if they make up a triangle and what type of triangle it is. {15/02/2019}
By Michelle Mukami Gitau

##Description

The website has three boxes in which the user enters numerical values. Upon submitting, the webpage determines what type of triangle the value makes up, if it's a triangle at all.
